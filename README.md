INTRODUCTION

I am a student of Zetech University undertaking Diploma in software engineering as a career path. 
With this project, I managed to transform my idea into a fast scalable digitized business inventory and financial tracking system. 
The system is targeting photographers and even other enterprises,  seeking for transparency, efficiency, reliability, and 
accountable in business transactions. This work piece is a product of a comprehensive online research. 
I executed it with programming skills introducing new development technologies, coupling digital security with user interactivity, 
efficiency and scalability making it open for business growth in a fast growing digital world.

PROBLEM STSTEMENT

Professional freelance photographers are experiencing challenges in tracking down 
expenses, revenues, inventories, finance, client management and reporting. Poor 
record keeping, unpaid bills, lack of financial accountability, that overwhelms any
entrepreneur.  If these problems remain unlocked, the photography industry would
always remain static, unattractive and in conflict with photographer’s aspirations.

JUSTIFICATION

 overwhelms any entrepreneur.  If these problems remains unlocked, the photography

 photographers’ aspirations. The system offers a one portal solution that is 
 compound and business profit driven.
